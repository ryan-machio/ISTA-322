1. Describe URL routing. As part of your answer, discuss the concept of \clean URLs."
  - Instead of going to a different page, you stay on the same page and the content changes.
  - Clean URLs give you the control over your URL schema and its relationship to your application, offering you the freedom to create a pattern of URLs that is meaningful and useful to your uses, without the need to conform to a predefined pattern.
1. What is the relationship between Microsoft's .NET platform and ASP.NET MVC?
  - ASP.NET Core MVC is built for the .NET platform, so its API can take full advantage of language and runtime innovations familiar to c# programmers.
1. Chapter 1 does not discuss the MVC pattern specifically, and in a sense this entire course is an extended examination of the MVC pattern. Using an independent resource (such as Wikipedia) briefly state the responsibility of (a) the model, (b) the controller, and (c) the view.
  - Model: represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data.  It can also have the logic to update controller if its data changes.
  - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.
  - Controller acts on both model and view.  IT controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.
