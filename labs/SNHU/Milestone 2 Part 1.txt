# The best practices used in this code were simple is better than complex and complex is better than complicated.
# Simple is better than complex is portrayed while creating the menu's, along with outputting the menu of automotive services.
# Complex is better than complicated is portrayed in the if-else and else-if statements.  The complexity of the code is that it draws
# variables from menu2 instead of menu, as the dictionary menu contains only strings.  The reason behind this is to calculate the prices
# of the services selected from the menu using math properties, as you can only add or subtract using integers or floats, and not strings.
# The algoirthm and data structure chosen to complete this task were most effective because the code follows a step-by-step procedure
# that is built from a foundation.  The foundation would be the menus and displaying the automotive menu.  Following that would be
# processing the input values to output the correct information.  The if-else and else-if statements are used to assist in calculating
# the final value of the services.
